# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Single-Image 3D Reconstruction and Diffusion-Based Denoising

## Overview

This project introduces a novel approach for generating realistic 3D models from a single 2D image using **Gaussian Splatting** and **diffusion-based denoising**. Our method enables photorealistic 3D avatar reconstruction and animation, removing the dependency on multiple views or high-resolution input data, which have traditionally been necessary for high-quality 3D reconstruction.

We utilize a combination of generative models like **VAE** and **StyleGAN** to generate initial 2D features, and Gaussian splatting for efficient 3D scene representation. By applying diffusion-based denoising techniques, we progressively refine the 3D structure, ensuring consistency and realism across different viewpoints.

## Key Features

- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Representing a scene as a collection of 3D Gaussians that allows flexibility and real-time rendering.
- **Diffusion-based Denoising**: Progressive noise reduction while maintaining alignment with the 2D input image.
- **FLAME Mesh Integration**: For animating and rendering human head avatars with high fidelity, including facial expressions and geometry details.
- **Real-time Performance**: Achieves fast rendering without requiring high-resolution or multi-view datasets.

## Methodology

- **Gaussian Splatting** is used to represent the 3D scene as discrete geometric primitives (Gaussians) that are blended in image space.
- **Diffusion-based Denoising** progressively refines the noisy Gaussians to produce high-quality 3D reconstructions.
- **FLAME Mesh** is integrated for precise control over the 3D avatars, allowing the representation of facial expressions and head animations.
- **Generative Models**: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and StyleGAN are used to generate the initial 2D features for reconstruction.
